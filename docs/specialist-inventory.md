# Specialist & Contract Documentation Inventory

Purpose: record the Phase 0 issue #3 audit to confirm required specialist docs and Agent 5 contract assets are present and within scope.

## Specialist doc check
- Located: `current-state.md`, `api-as-is.md`, `data-as-is.md`, `gaps-core.md`, `known-issues.md`, `search-log.md`, `screen-map.md`, `ui-ux-spec.md`, `ux-acceptance.md`, `threat-model.md`, `security-ops.md`, `testing-ci.md`, `runbooks.md`, `contradictions.md`.
- Scope note: doc set matches foundation scope only; product/attachment/admin features remain out of scope until planned tasks land.

## Agent 5 contract deliverables
- Located: `contract-conventions.md`, `error-model.md`, `api-contracts-as-is.md`, `api-contracts-target.md`, `openapi.yaml`, `contract-tests.md`, `migration-contracts.md`.
- Ownership: API/contracts maintainer (K-Kabak) keeps these aligned with code and OpenAPI updates.

## Absent inputs
- None as of 2025-12-22 review. Owner: K-Kabak (Docs/Contracts) to backfill and re-run inventory when scope changes.
